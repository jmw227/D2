# D2
Deliverable 2 for CS1632_Fall


For this assignment, you and a partner (NOT the same partner as you worked with on D1) will write code and unit tests for Ruby Gold Rush, a simulator of prospectors hunting for gold and silver during the California Gold Rush and the Nevada Silver Rush.

Requirements for this program are in the requirements.md file in this directory. Sample output is also provided for several runs of the program. In case of ambiguity, please see the sample output as an example of what to display and how the system should work. Note that the sample output shows specific routes for given seeds - you do NOT have to have your seeds create the exact same routes. They are purely for demonstration purposes.

This program must be written in Ruby and use minitest for the unit tests. This program must use rubocop with the attached .rubocop.yml configuration and SimpleCov as described in class.
